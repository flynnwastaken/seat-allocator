# seat-allocator-2010
This Ruby project lets you assign an arbitrary number of House of Representatives seats to the states according to the accepted method.

It uses default data from the 2010 US census, as the House did when they last allocated seats to states. After we have 2020 US census data I will create an updated version that defaults to that data but includes the option to use the 2010 data as well.
