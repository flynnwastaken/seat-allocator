# seat-allocator
This Ruby project lets you assign an arbitrary number of House of Representatives seats to the states according to [the accepted method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%E2%80%93Hill_method).

The 2010 version uses default data from the 2010 US Census, and the 2020 version uses default data from the 2020 US Census.
